# The Curse Of Menhir
 
## Background

Welcome to The Curse Of Menhir. This game is a short retro fantasy RPG inspired by several classic titles from the early video game era like Angband, Dungeons of Daggorath and Zork. The entire game is made in C++ with terminal visuals and uses no major game development libraries.

## Installation

**NOTE**: Installation currently works **ONLY** for **64-bit Windows**.

There are currently two methods of Installation:

### Installer

This method is very simple. 

Simply download and run **theCurseOfMenhirSetup.exe** in **Releases**. 

You'll be prompted to choose where to save your game files (I recommend the default it gives you) and when it's finished installing, it'll run like a normal program. 

You also have the option to create a **Desktop shortcut** for the game if you wish.  

### Zip file

This method is simple too, but with a couple things to keep in mind. 

Download **theCurseOfMenhir.zip** from **Releases** and unzip it in whatever location you wish. 

I recommend unzipping all the contents into a **new folder**. 

The zip file has the game's **theCurseOfMenhir.exe** file and a folder called **audio** that stores all the game's audio files. 

In order for the game to run correctly, simply make sure that the **theCurseOfMenhir.exe** file and the **audio folder** are in the **same folder**.

##Tips

Screen Size: I recommend to play in full screen to avoid any screen distortion when printing images to the terminal.

Use Zoom in/Zoom out as needed to also fix any screen distortion.
